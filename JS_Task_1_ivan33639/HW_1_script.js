//1. In this task you have to declare four variables: a = 0,1; b = 0,7; c = 0,2; d = 0,8;

var a = 0.1; 
var b = 0.7; 
var c = 0.2; 
var d = 0.8;

//2. After that, console.log the following mathematical operations:

console.log(a + b); console.log(a + a + d); console.log(c + d);

//3. Analyse the results and record any mathematical discrepancies.

// console.log of (a + b) shows '0.7999999999999999'- it's not rounded, the other cases seems correct.
